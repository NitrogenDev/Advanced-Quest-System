## Setup

**Prerequisites**

* Unreal Engine 4

Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/NitrogenDev/Advanced-Quest-System-UE4`.

Open `QuestSystem.uproject`. If you're prompted for a version, I suggest using **4.25**.

### Blueprint implementation

1. Migrate the code from the original project to your project
2. In your character class, add the `Quest_Component` component
3. Copy and paste the code and variables related to the quest system from the `ThirdPersonCharacter` class from the original project
4. Replace all casts to the `ThirdPersonCharacter` class with a cast to your character class.

### C++ implementation

Migration currently in progress.

## Features

* Easy-to-use API, which can easily be expanded further.

* Event-driven quest completion.

* Interaction with the other parts of the system is done through event dispatchers.

* Dynamically add per-NPC quests with any amount of steps, even at runtime.

* Quest updates notifications.

* When the game is stopped, everything related to the questing and NPC system is saved. **This also happens when an actor of type `ThirdPersonCharacter` or `NPC_Quest`is destroyed.**
